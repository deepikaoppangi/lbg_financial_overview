Finance Snapshot POC – Use Cases & User Stories

1. Purpose of the Application

This application demonstrates a retail banking ‘financial snapshot’ capability. It helps an individual customer understand their financial position at a glance, observe trends over time, and explore simple future scenarios. The focus is insight, clarity, and explanation — not transactions or advice.

2. Primary Use Cases

Use Case 1: Understand spending patterns

As a retail banking customer, I want to see my expenses broken down by category (e.g., housing, groceries, education, healthcare, transport), so that I understand where my money goes every month.

Use Case 2: Track income, expenses, and savings over time

As a customer, I want to see how my income, expenses, and savings evolve over 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years, so that I can understand financial trends rather than isolated numbers.

Use Case 3: Assess financial resilience and liquidity

As a customer, I want to see simple indicators of resilience and liquidity, so that I know how well I could handle unexpected expenses or income disruption.

Use Case 4: Receive insight summary (non-advisory)

As a customer, I want a concise insight summary that explains my current financial position in plain language, without giving advice or recommendations.

Use Case 5: Explore future scenarios (optional AI)

As a customer, I want to ask high-level questions such as “Can I retire at 65?” or “How much can I spend on a holiday?”, so that I can understand potential gaps between my current trajectory and future goals. These simulations are illustrative and optional.
